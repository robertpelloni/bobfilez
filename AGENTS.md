## Where to Look

| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add scanner/hasher/provider | `core/src/`, `core/include/fo/core/` | Use Registry pattern |
| Add CLI command | `cli/cmd_*.cpp` | Follow existing cmd_ pattern |
| Add test | `tests/test_*.cpp` | GTest fixtures |
| Update dependencies | `vcpkg.json` | Then rebuild |
| Submodule info | `docs/SUBMODULES.md` | Auto-generated dashboard |

## Code Patterns

**Registry Pattern** (providers):
```cpp
static auto reg = []() {
    Registry<IFileScanner>::instance().add("name", []() {
        return std::make_unique<MyScannerImpl>();
    });
    return true;
}();
```

**Feature Guards**: `#ifdef FO_HAVE_TESSERACT`, `#ifdef FO_HAVE_BLAKE3`, etc.

**Platform Guards**: `#ifdef _WIN32` for Windows-specific code.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER)

- ❌ `as any`, `@ts-ignore` equivalents — no type suppression
- ❌ Modify files in `libs/` directly — they're submodules
- ❌ Hardcode version — read from `VERSION.md`
- ❌ Skip tests after changes — always verify with `fo_tests.exe`
- ❌ Commit without conventional prefix — use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`

## Conventions

- **C++20**: `std::filesystem`, `std::optional`, `std::chrono`
- **Naming**: `snake_case` functions/variables, `CamelCase` classes
- **Headers**: `.hpp`, `#pragma once`, includes grouped (std → external → internal)
- **Versioning**: `VERSION.md` = single source of truth, SemVer

## Version Update Protocol

1. Edit `VERSION.md` (single line)
2. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"`
4. Push

## Submodule Commands

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive      # Initialize all
git submodule status                         # Check status
python scripts/generate_dashboard.py         # Update dashboard
```

## Current Status (v6.0.51)

- ✅ **BobGUI C API Shim**: Added a small native C ABI library target, `fo_c_api`, exposing JSON-returning wrappers for scan, duplicates, statistics, hash, and metadata workflows plus explicit string-lifetime helpers and error reporting. This creates the first honest direct-integration seam for future BobGUI/native-C consumers without forcing them through the full C++ API surface.
- ✅ **BobGUI CLI Bridge Expansion**: Reworked `frontends/bobgui_app/main.c` from a static placeholder into a functional BobGUI-native control surface with a path entry, action buttons, status messaging, a scrollable output view, and asynchronous CLI-backed actions for scan, duplicates, statistics, hash, and metadata.
- ✅ **Frontend Parity Expansion**: Continued the new `frontends/` strategy by broadening the practical workflow surface instead of leaving the newer lanes at scan-only scaffolding.
- ✅ **React Web UI (No-Build SPA)**: The `bobui_web/public/react/app.js` React frontend now exposes interactive **Scanner**, **Duplicates**, **Statistics**, **Hasher**, and **Metadata** views backed by the Express/CLI bridge, with corrected handling for the real CLI JSON shapes.
- ✅ **Qt Demo Expansion**: Expanded `fo_qt_demo` into a broader Qt Widgets frontend with **Dashboard**, **Scanner**, **Duplicates**, **Statistics**, and **Hasher** tabs, each calling real `fo_core` logic off the UI thread.
- ✅ **BobUI Demo Expansion**: Expanded the `fo_bobui_demo` QML lane to the same next-tier workflow family through `QmlEngineWrapper`, proving that the BobUI demo can drive real scan/duplicate/stat/hash backend actions once a compatible Qt runtime is present.
- ✅ **Pure Qt Lane Decoupling**: Stopped routing the plain Qt demo through BobUI-specific Qt package discovery and updated `scripts/build_qt_gui.bat` to auto-detect the visible `D:\Qt\6.11.0\mingw_64` host kit while warning honestly about the current MinGW-vs-MSVC mismatch.
- ✅ **JUCE Native Parity**: Expanded the `fo_juce_demo` target (`frontends/juce/src/main.cpp`) to invoke an asynchronous native OS file browser (`juce::FileChooser`). It triggers a directory selection which routes directly into the C++ `fo::core::Registry<fo::core::IFileScanner>` executing a true backend `std` scan, aggregating byte sizes, and safely reporting accurate results directly to the JUCE GUI canvas without blocking the main message thread.
- ✅ **Multi-Frontend Matrix**: Added demo targets for plain Qt6, BobUI, JUCE, BTK, and BobGUI to explicitly support the multi-framework requirement. Added a lightweight React Web UI alongside the classic `bobui_web` dashboard. Added `libs/JUCE` as a submodule and officially tracked `libs/bobui` and `libs/btk` in `.gitmodules`. Added explicit build scripts for the new frontend demos.

- ✅ **BobUI Runtime Reality Check**: Refined the active BobUI direction so bobfilez now treats BobUI as the active Omni/UI layer while discovering Qt6 packages via `QT6_ROOT` / `QT_ROOT` / `QTDIR` / `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` instead of over-assuming the local BobUI tree is always a complete self-contained Qt6 QML provider.
- ✅ **BobUI MSVC qtmochelpers Fix**: Patched `libs/bobui/src/corelib/kernel/qtmochelpers.h` so the in-place MSVC BobUI build gets past the old `qlocale.cpp` / `qtmochelpers.h` generic-lambda lookup failure; pushed the fix upstream and advanced the bobfilez gitlink to the merged BobUI `main` state.
- ✅ **BobUI Host Runtime Boundary Clarified**: Confirmed BobUI's own CI expects external Qt modules such as `qtdeclarative`, and confirmed this host's visible Qt6 QML desktop kit under `D:\Qt` is currently `mingw_64` rather than MSVC; the current native blocker is therefore an honest runtime/toolchain mismatch plus the still-incomplete local BobUI QML package surface, not just the old `QLocale` source failure.
- ✅ **Native UI Profile Listing**: Added a user-facing `--list-native-ui-profiles` command so the launch-profile architecture is discoverable without inspecting code, while preserving the default launch behavior when the flag is absent.
- ✅ **Explorer-Only Native Launch Profile**: Added the second genuinely alternate named launch profile, `omni-explorer-only`, backed by its own focused root QML surface (`qrc:/ExplorerShell.qml`) hosting `ExplorerWindow` with a local `FileModel` and minimal shell shim.
- ✅ **Dashboard-Only Native Launch Profile**: Added the first genuinely alternate named launch profile, `omni-dashboard-only`, backed by a different root QML surface (`qrc:/DashboardShell.qml`) instead of being a fake alias of the full shell root.
- ✅ **Native UI Profile CLI Selection**: Implemented the seventh Option C refinement by adding a command-line selection seam for named launch profiles with explicit CLI > env > default precedence.
- ✅ **Native UI Profile Environment Selection**: Implemented the sixth Option C refinement by adding an environment-driven selection seam for named launch profiles via `BOBFILEZ_NATIVE_UI_PROFILE`, with safe fallback to the default profile when unset or unknown.
- ✅ **Native UI Profile Registry**: Implemented the fifth Option C refinement by adding a small registry/helper layer for named launch profiles and runtime bundles, allowing the bootstrap to select the default profile by name instead of directly constructing policy inline.
- ✅ **BTK Upstream Refresh**: Updated `libs/btk` to the newer upstream master, rebased the two required local MSVC fixes on top of it, confirmed BTK still builds successfully on this host, and verified bobfilez still stops at the same honest downstream boundary: missing `Declarative`.
- ✅ **Native UI Launch Profiles and Runtime Bundles**: Implemented the fourth Option C refactor by replacing the raw launch-config callback bag with clearer named policy units: `NativeUiRuntimeBundle` for runtime/registration policy and `NativeUiLaunchProfile` for shell launch policy.
- ✅ **Native UI Launch Config**: Implemented the third Option C refactor by turning active shell launch policy into explicit configuration data (`NativeUiLaunchConfig`) so the bootstrap no longer hardcodes the main QML URL, registration bundle, runtime factory, and root-object failure policy inline.
- ✅ **Native UI Runtime Policy Extraction**: Implemented the second Option C refactor by separating bootstrap orchestration, declarative runtime construction, and QML type-registration policy into narrower units (`NativeUiBootstrap`, `NativeUiRuntime`, and `OmniQmlRegistration`) while preserving the active runtime behavior.
- ✅ **Native UI Bootstrap Seam**: Implemented the first real Option C refactor by extracting the active shell runtime bootstrap out of `gui/omni/src/main.cpp` and into a narrower `NativeUiBootstrap` seam, reducing direct provider coupling while preserving the current runtime behavior.
- ✅ **BTK Framework Decision Matrix**: Converted the BTK probe series into an explicit architecture decision. The documented least-destructive app strategy is now to keep bobfilez on its modern QQml-style shell path, reduce provider coupling, and treat BTK modernization as a separate upstream R&D effort rather than the immediate shell runtime target.
- ✅ **BTK Native Provider Probe Round 5**: Confirmed the compatibility gap is also a framework-generation mismatch: BTK's current declarative surface is `QDeclarative*`-era and no real `QQml*` / `QQuick*` provider surface was found, while bobfilez's active native bootstrap is explicitly `QQmlApplicationEngine`-based.
- ✅ **BTK Native Provider Probe Round 4**: Experimentally re-enabled BTK `Declarative` just long enough to prove the gap is deeper than a missing top-level component toggle: the module immediately hits stale declarative-specific CMake, obsolete metatype usage, and fatal missing QtScript-era headers such as `QtScript/qscriptvalue.h`.
- ✅ **BTK Native Provider Probe Round 3**: Repaired BTK's earlier MSVC build blockers, confirmed `scripts/build_btk_inplace.bat` now produces real framework outputs such as `CsCore2.1.lib`, and proved the next bobfilez-side blocker is now the absence of an exported `Declarative` / QML component in the current BTK package surface.
- ✅ **BTK Native Provider Probe Round 2**: Added a dedicated BTK build-tree package-prep step, repaired import-prefix handling for the prepared BTK/CopperSpice export files, and confirmed the remaining blocker is now the absence of built BTK libraries (for example `CsCore2.1.lib`) after BTK's own build fails in `btkinputowner.*`.
- ✅ **BTK Native Provider Probe**: Registered `libs/btk` as a real tracked submodule, confirmed BTK configures in place on this host, fixed the initial BTK package-hint ordering bug in `cmake/BTKFrameworkSetup.cmake`, and demonstrated that the current blocker is now BTK build/export readiness rather than legacy BobUI wiring.
- ✅ **BTK Native Framework Switch**: Replaced the active BobUI/Qt-fork integration path with a BTK-oriented provider model, added `cmake/BTKFrameworkSetup.cmake`, renamed the native GUI scripts to `build_btk_*.bat`, removed the BobUI-specific `OmniQmlRegistration` bootstrap dependency, and replaced active BobUI QML imports in the photo panels.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Gamification Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `GamificationPanel.qml`, replacing labels, the `ProgressBar`, the `GroupBox` section, and the stock `ToolTip` behavior with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 35 QML files to 34.
- ✅ **Fifth Routed-Panel Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed the panel-layer migration rule now extends beyond simple dashboard cards into a lightweight hover-detail surface, still without reintroducing stock Controls.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Forensic Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `ForensicPanel.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, the `GroupBox` section, and the stock `ScrollBar` attachment with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 36 QML files to 35.
- ✅ **Fourth Routed-Panel Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed the panel-layer migration rule is holding across multiple dashboard-style surfaces, strengthening confidence in continued selective reduction.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Recovery Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `RecoveryPanel.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, and the `GroupBox` section with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 37 QML files to 36.
- ✅ **Third Routed-Panel Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed the panel-layer pattern is now supported by three successful dashboard-style conversions, strengthening the case for continuing with similar low-diversity panels before richer surfaces.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Swarm Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `SwarmPanel.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, the `GroupBox` section, and the `ProgressBar` with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 38 QML files to 37.
- ✅ **Second Routed-Panel Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed the panel-layer pattern is holding: self-contained dashboard-style panels remain the safest next-wave candidates after the shell-assets layer.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Digital Rot Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `DigitalRotPanel.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, and the `GroupBox` section with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 39 QML files to 38.
- ✅ **First Routed-Panel Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed the campaign has successfully moved beyond shell assets and into the routed panel layer, starting with the simplest interaction-light panel target.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Dashboard Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `Dashboard.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, `GroupBox`, and `ProgressBar` usage with plain `QtQuick` primitives and local helper components, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 40 QML files to 39.
- ✅ **Shell-Assets Controls-Free Milestone**: Confirmed `gui/omni/assets/` now contains zero QML files importing `QtQuick.Controls`.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Main Host Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `main.qml` by converting the localized notification-center surface to plain `QtQuick` primitives, reducing the global controls-import footprint from 41 QML files to 40.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls OmniPeek Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `OmniPeekOverlay.qml`, replacing labels, header/buttons, and the `ScrollView`/`TextArea` stack with lighter `QtQuick` primitives and reducing the global controls-import footprint from 42 QML files to 41.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Explorer Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `ExplorerWindow.qml`, replacing labels, buttons, delegates, and the stock scroll bar with lighter `QtQuick` primitives and reducing the global controls-import footprint from 43 QML files to 42.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Second Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `DesktopIcons.qml`, `NexusPulse.qml`, and `WindowManager.qml`, reducing the global controls-import footprint further from 46 QML files to 43.
- ✅ **QtQuick.Controls Initial Reduction**: Removed `QtQuick.Controls` usage from `Taskbar.qml` and `StartMenu.qml`, replacing trivial stock controls with lighter `QtQuick` primitives and reducing the global controls-import footprint from 48 QML files to 46.
- ✅ **BobUI Registration Alignment**: Corrected the stale `OmniUI/core` path to the real `OmniUI/omnicore` layout, wired BobUI omnicore sources/includes into the GUI targets, and added a real `OmniUI::registerQmlTypes()` call in the native shell bootstrap.
- ✅ **GraphicalEffects Full Removal**: Simplified the six remaining real GraphicalEffects users and fully removed `QtGraphicalEffects` / `Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects` usage from the entire `gui/` tree.
- ✅ **GraphicalEffects Import Cleanup**: Audited actual versus dead effect usage and removed stale `QtGraphicalEffects` / `Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects` imports from 27 QML files while preserving the small set of files that still genuinely use `DropShadow` / `FastBlur`.
- ✅ **QtCharts Removal**: Removed the dead `QtCharts` import from `EnhancedFileOpsPanel.qml`; the panel's live speed graph was already implemented with a `Canvas`, so this safely shrank the GUI dependency surface without affecting behavior.
- ✅ **Markdown WebEngine Removal**: Added a native `NativeMarkdownView` preview item, removed `QtWebEngine` / `WebEngineView` usage from `MarkdownViewerPanel.qml`, and removed `WebEngineQuick` from the `fo_omni` dependency set while confirming the remaining BobUI consumer blocker is still `Qt6Qml`.
- ✅ **BobUI Native Migration Audit**: Added `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_NATIVE_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md` and confirmed the current shell is still ~10k lines of QML; removing `WebEngineQuick` is feasible, but removing `QtQuick` itself is not realistic with current BobUI because BobUI widgets are built on `QQuickItem` / `QQuickPaintedItem`.
- ✅ **BobUI In-Place Build Probe**: Added `scripts/build_bobui_inplace.bat` and confirmed BobUI can export a top-level `Qt6Config.cmake` from an in-place developer build, but the current BobUI tree still lacks `Qt6Qml` and therefore is not yet a full drop-in provider for bobfilez's GUI targets.
- ✅ **BOBGUI Comparison Added**: Added `libs/bobgui` as a submodule and documented the architectural comparison in `docs/ai/implementation/BOBGUI_VS_BOBUI.md`; conclusion: BobUI remains the correct primary native UI foundation for bobfilez.
- ✅ **BobUI Submodule Updated**: Advanced `libs/bobui` to `581de545a4` from upstream `origin/main`.
- ✅ **BobUI-First GUI Provider Wiring**: Added `cmake/BobUIQtSetup.cmake` and updated the root build so GUI / Omni targets prefer the local BobUI fork (`libs/bobui` / `BOBUI_ROOT`) as the Qt6 package provider instead of assuming a separately installed stock Qt.
- ✅ **BobUI Probe Script & Findings**: Added `scripts/build_bobui_gui.bat` and confirmed that a raw `libs/bobui` checkout is detected but still fails GUI configure until BobUI exports a built Qt6 package layout (`Qt6Config.cmake`).
- ✅ **BobUI Integration Documentation**: Added `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_PROVIDER_SETUP.md` and updated `README.md` to clarify that BobUI is a Qt fork supplying normal `Qt6::*` targets, not a separate target namespace.
- ✅ **Go-Port Status Clarified**: Confirmed there is no active bobfilez Go port in the current repository state, and removed the obsolete `filez-java/` experiment so no alternate port is currently maintained in-tree.
- ✅ **Headless Build Stabilization**: Added `scripts/build_headless.bat`, optionalized native `ffmpeg`/`chromaprint` behind the `media-analysis` feature in `vcpkg.json`, fixed headless MSVC compile issues across the expanded core/CLI surface, and verified a successful `build-msvc` build.
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Confirmed `fo_core`, `fo_cli`, `fo_tests`, and benchmark binaries build successfully in the headless MSVC profile; ran `build-msvc/tests/fo_tests.exe` with **63 / 63 tests passing**.
- ✅ **Tracked-Only Status Workflow**: Added `scripts/repo_status.py` and documented that `git status --untracked-files=no` avoids the current Windows long-path warning path while still surfacing tracked changes and dirty submodules.
- ✅ **Generated Build Artifact Purge**: Removed tracked/generated component `build_output/` trees and documented the cleanup in `docs/ai/implementation/REPO_HYGIENE_CLEANUP.md`.
- ✅ **OmniShell Route Audit**: Added `docs/ai/implementation/OMNISHELL_ROUTE_AUDIT.md` to map shell route coverage across `main.qml`, Start Menu, Taskbar, and explorer-driven launch surfaces.
- ✅ **Taskbar Launcher Wiring**: Replaced placeholder taskbar app icons with real Bobfilez launchers for Explorer, OmniGit, OmniVision, OmniAudio, OmniTerminal, and OmniShare, including active-panel indicators.
- ✅ **OmniShell Bootstrap Stabilization**: Fixed the standalone OmniUI target to compile `TreemapModel.cpp`, register `fo::gui::TreemapModel` correctly, and boot from `qrc:/main.qml` using a lean Qt-native startup path.
- ✅ **Grand Architecture**: Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the unified OmniShell / Omni-tool architecture, subsystem taxonomy, product-parity goals, and current codebase metrics.
- ✅ **OmniShare Secure File Drops**: Built-in HTTPS-style share-link workflow with expiring links, revocation, and self-hosted transfer concepts.

### Update: 2026-04-04 (Session 44)
**Author:** GPT

**Scope:** v6.0.29 BTK Native Provider Probe Round 2

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `scripts/prepare_btk_buildtree_package.py` and `scripts/prepare_btk_buildtree_package.bat`.
- ✅ Updated `scripts/build_btk_gui.bat` to prepare a consumer-facing BTK build-tree package surface before probing bobfilez's BTK-backed GUI configure.
- ✅ Repaired the earlier import-prefix issue in the prepared BTK/CopperSpice export files so imported targets now point at `libs/btk/build-btk` instead of a broken relative prefix.
- ✅ Re-ran the BTK-backed GUI probe and confirmed the next blocker is now the absence of built BTK libraries such as `CsCore2.1.lib`, which directly traces back to BTK's own compile failure in `btkinputowner.*`.
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/BTK_PROVIDER_PROBE_ROUND2.md` documenting the improved prep step and the newly narrowed blocker.
- ✅ Re-ran headless validation so the versioned state remains current.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix BTK's own `btkinputowner.*` MSVC build failure so BTK can produce `CsCore2.1.lib` / related binaries.
2. Re-probe bobfilez GUI / Omni against that finished BTK build surface.
3. Only after BTK is building successfully should deeper BTK-native GUI adoption work continue.

**Scope:** v6.0.28 BTK Native Provider Probe

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Registered `libs/btk` as a real tracked submodule in the superproject.
- ✅ Ran `scripts/build_btk_inplace.bat` and confirmed BTK configures successfully on this machine before failing during its own compile in `btkinputowner.*`.
- ✅ Fixed the initial BTK provider-hint ordering bug in `cmake/BTKFrameworkSetup.cmake` so bobfilez prefers the generated `libs/btk/build-btk` package config over the raw source-tree template.
- ✅ Ran `scripts/build_btk_gui.bat` and confirmed the next blocker is now BTK build/export readiness: generated `BTKConfig.cmake` references missing companion export files for downstream consumption.
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/BTK_PROVIDER_PROBE.md` documenting the BTK in-place build result and the downstream package-export failure.
- ✅ Re-ran headless validation so the versioned state remains current.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix BTK's own `btkinputowner.*` MSVC build failure or produce a valid BTK install/export prefix.
2. Re-probe bobfilez GUI / Omni against that finished BTK package surface.
3. Continue historical BobUI-reference cleanup later, but keep the active build/debug path focused on BTK readiness first.

- ✅ Updated `gui/omni/CMakeLists.txt` to remove `WebEngineQuick` from required Qt components and link libraries.
- ✅ Updated `gui/CMakeLists.txt`, `gui/omni/src/main.cpp`, and `core/include/fo/core/markdown_viewer_interface.hpp` to support the native preview path cleanly.
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/MARKDOWN_WEBENGINE_REMOVAL.md` documenting the implementation, tradeoffs, and validation.
- ✅ Re-ran the BobUI consumer probe and confirmed the remaining blocker is still `Qt6Qml`, not `WebEngineQuick`.

**Next Steps:**
1. Use the same strategy on `QtCharts` next.

### Update: 2026-04-04 (Session 25)
**Author:** GPT

**Scope:** v6.0.10 BobUI Native Migration Cost Audit

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_NATIVE_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md` with a detailed breakdown of what it would cost to remove QML / Quick / WebEngine from bobfilez.
- ✅ Quantified the current native UI surface as 49 QML files, 9,844 QML lines, and 39 shell/panel routes.
- ✅ Confirmed that current BobUI widgets/layouts are Quick-based (`QQuickItem` / `QQuickPaintedItem`), so a BobUI-first migration does not currently remove the `QtQuick` dependency.
- ✅ Confirmed current bobfilez bootstrap is still only registering `FileModel` and `TreemapModel`, not the broader BobUI QML type surface.
- ✅ Produced a phased recommendation: remove `WebEngineQuick` first, then reduce other stock Qt module usage, then incrementally adopt BobUI widgets while keeping QML as a composition layer for now.

**Next Steps:**
1. Start with the smallest high-value cut: replace `MarkdownViewerPanel.qml` / `QtWebEngine`.
2. Audit `QtCharts` and `GraphicalEffects` replacements next.
3. Only pursue wholesale QML reduction after BobUI-native widget adoption is real and wired.

### Update: 2026-04-04 (Session 24)
**Author:** GPT

**Scope:** v6.0.9 In-Place BobUI Build Probe

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `scripts/build_bobui_inplace.bat` to configure/build BobUI itself under `libs/bobui/build-bobui`.
- ✅ Confirmed BobUI can configure in place and export `lib/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake` when the MSVC minimum-version gate is explicitly overridden.
- ✅ Re-ran bobfilez against the BobUI build tree and confirmed the next blocker is missing `Qt6Qml` (and therefore no current path to `Qt6Quick`, `Qt6QuickControls2`, or `Qt6WebEngineQuick`).
- ✅ Updated `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_PROVIDER_SETUP.md` with the exact provider/build findings.

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide whether to expand BobUI's module surface or refactor bobfilez away from its current QML/Quick/WebEngine dependency set.
2. Keep using `scripts/build_bobui_inplace.bat` and `scripts/build_bobui_gui.bat` as the standard BobUI validation scripts.
3. Do not assume the remaining issue is just package discovery; the missing component set is now the primary blocker.

### Update: 2026-04-04 (Session 23)
**Author:** GPT

**Scope:** v6.0.8 BOBGUI Evaluation vs BobUI

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `libs/bobgui` as a new submodule pointing to `https://github.com/robertpelloni/bobgui`.

- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/BOBGUI_VS_BOBUI.md` capturing the comparison and recommendation.
- ✅ Confirmed that for bobfilez specifically, **BobUI is the better library** because it aligns with the existing Qt/QML/Omni direction and avoids a frontend rewrite.

**Next Steps:**
1. Keep `bobgui` as a reference/alternative toolkit only.
2. Continue pursuing BobUI as the native shell/UI foundation.
3. Build/install BobUI so bobfilez can finally resolve `Qt6Config.cmake` from a BobUI-built prefix.

- ✅ Removed the obsolete `filez-java/` tree plus Java-only packaging artifacts (`scripts/package_java_msi.bat`, `wix/filez_java.wxs`).
- ✅ Added `scripts/build_bobui_gui.bat` as a repeatable BobUI-backed GUI/Omni configure/build probe.
- ✅ Confirmed the current GUI blocker precisely: BobUI source checkout is detected, but configure still fails until BobUI exports `Qt6Config.cmake` / `qt6-config.cmake` from a built/install prefix.
- ✅ Updated `README.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_PROVIDER_SETUP.md` to reflect the new BobUI-first path and alternate-port cleanup.

**Next Steps:**
1. Build/install BobUI itself so its Qt6 package configs exist.
2. Point `BOBUI_ROOT` at that built/exported prefix and rerun `scripts/build_bobui_gui.bat`.
3. If needed, add a source-tree fallback integration later, but the cleanest path is still BobUI-as-built-provider.

**Author:** GPT

**Scope:** v6.0.6 BobUI Provider Wiring & Go-Port Status Audit

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `cmake/BobUIQtSetup.cmake` so GUI / Omni builds prefer `libs/bobui` / `BOBUI_ROOT` as the Qt6 package provider.
- ✅ Updated the root `CMakeLists.txt` option wording from generic Qt to BobUI-oriented GUI / Omni naming.
- ✅ Updated `gui/CMakeLists.txt`, `gui/omni/CMakeLists.txt`, and `README.md` to clarify that BobUI is the preferred Qt fork for native UI builds.
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/BOBUI_PROVIDER_SETUP.md` documenting the correct BobUI-as-provider integration model.
- ✅ Audited the repo for a maintained Go implementation and confirmed there is no active bobfilez Go port in the current tree.
- ✅ Re-ran the headless path to ensure BobUI discovery changes did not break non-GUI builds.

**Next Steps:**
1. Build/install BobUI itself so its exported Qt6 package configs are available to bobfilez.
2. Re-run a full `FO_BUILD_GUI=ON` / `FO_BUILD_OMNI=ON` configure using `BOBUI_ROOT`.
3. If a Go port still exists, recover it from a separate repo/branch intentionally instead of assuming it remains in this tree.

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Added `scripts/build_headless.bat` to provide a repeatable Windows/MSVC/Ninja fallback build with `FO_BUILD_GUI=OFF` and `FO_BUILD_OMNI=OFF`.
- ✅ Updated `vcpkg.json` to move `ffmpeg` and `chromaprint` behind the optional `media-analysis` feature instead of forcing them into the default dependency graph.
- ✅ Fixed latent compile errors across the expanded core/CLI implementation surface and removed the final MSVC warning in `cli/fo_cli.cpp`.
- ✅ Added `docs/ai/implementation/HEADLESS_BUILD_STABILIZATION.md` documenting the dependency strategy, build script, compile fixes, and remaining Qt6 blocker.
- ✅ Verified successful build outputs for `fo_core`, `fo_cli`, `fo_tests`, and benchmarks under `build-msvc/`.
- ✅ Ran `build-msvc/tests/fo_tests.exe` successfully: **63 / 63 tests passed**.

**Next Steps:**
1. Re-run a full GUI/Omni build once Qt6 is available on the machine.
2. Decide whether the optional `media-analysis` feature should remain opt-in permanently or be reintroduced into a richer default/dev profile later.
3. Continue backend hardening for the still-scaffolded Omni subsystems now that headless verification is reliable again.

### Update: 2026-02-07 (Session 2)
**Author:** Sisyphus (Gemini)

**Scope:** Java Port Feature Completion

**Status:**
- ✅ **Java Features**: Implemented near-full parity with C++ CLI.
  - `undo`, `history`: Operation tracking and rollback.
  - `metadata`: Using `metadata-extractor` (EXIF/IPTC/XMP).
  - `ocr`: Using `tess4j` (Tesseract wrapper).
  - `similar`: Perceptual hashing (dHash/aHash) with pure Java implementation.
  - `export`: JSON/CSV/HTML export.
  - `stats`: File statistics.
  - `rename`, `delete-duplicates`: Batch operations.
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Added `libs/BLAKE3` submodule and native build script.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Native Build**: Run `filez-java/native/compile_native_win.bat` (requires MSVC).
2. **Packaging**: Build MSI and Java fat JARs.
3. **AI Classification**: Implement `classify` command in Java (deferred, requires ONNX).

**Handoff Note:**
The Java port is now feature-complete for all core file organization tasks (deduplication, metadata, OCR, perceptual hash, organization). Only AI object classification is missing compared to the C++ version.

### Update: 2026-01-12
**Author:** Sisyphus (Claude)

**Scope:** Java 21 port - complete migration of filez to Java with JNI support

**Status:**
- ✅ Created `filez-java/` - full Java 21 port with multi-module Gradle structure
- ✅ Core types as Java records: `FileInfo`, `Hashes`, `DuplicateGroup`, `ScanResult`, etc.
- ✅ Interfaces: `FileScanner`, `Hasher`, `MetadataProvider`, `OCRProvider`, `Classifier`
- ✅ Registry pattern for provider management (same as C++ version)
- ✅ Implementations: `NioFileScanner`, `JavaHasher` (SHA-256, MD5, XXH64)
- ✅ Database layer: `DatabaseManager`, `FileRepository`, `DuplicateRepository` (SQLite)
- ✅ CLI with picocli: `scan`, `hash`, `duplicates`, `metadata`, `organize` commands
- ✅ JNI stubs: `Blake3Jni`, `XxHash64Jni`, `NativeHasher` with auto-fallback
- ✅ 30 JUnit 5 tests (all passing): `NioFileScannerTest`, `JavaHasherTest`, `FileRepositoryTest`
- ✅ Run scripts: `filez.bat`, `filez.sh` with memory flags
- ✅ Committed and pushed: `1bfa2831`

**Project Structure:**
```
filez-java/
├── core/           # Types, interfaces, implementations, database
├── cli/            # picocli commands (FilezApp entry point)
├── native/         # JNI wrappers (com.filez.jni package)
├── build/          # Compiled classes
└── *.jar           # Dependencies (picocli, sqlite-jdbc, junit, slf4j)
```

**Next:**
1. Build native library (`filez_native.dll`/`.so`) with BLAKE3/XXHash64 JNI implementations
2. Add Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) for proper build automation
3. Create fat JAR for single-file distribution
4. Add more tests for CLI commands and DuplicateRepository
5. Consider GraalVM native-image for startup performance

**Handoff Note:**
Java port is functional and tested. CLI works: `filez scan`, `filez duplicates`, etc. JNI stubs ready for native implementation. The C++ version remains the production codebase; Java port is for cross-platform distribution and JVM ecosystem integration.
